# Witch Wing
Witch Wing is a mobile game in the endless flyer genre. It was created in [Unity](https://unity.com/) by [Trollpants Game Studio](https://github.com/Trollpants) in 2014.

## Open Source Release
Nearly all of the source code was rewritten for this release. This was to both clean it up and to get rid of some dependencies. Ads and IAPs have also been removed, which necessitated some minor redesign of menus and game balance.

As a bonus, it's now possible to downgrade the player skills. This was a long requested feature, as many players had trouble getting used to the controls when the tilt sensitivity was upgraded a lot.

## Release History
Witch Wing was first released on Amazon Appstore on July 21st, 2014. Later that year it was released on Google Play and Apple App Store on October 30th and November 14th respectively.

## CloudOnce
[CloudOnce](https://github.com/CloudOnce) was used to implement Amazon GameCircle, [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and [Apple Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).
